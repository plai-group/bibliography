# bibliography

We keep .bib files with the scientific output of the group in this area. The files are broken down based on type of contribution:
* Publications (reports, conference papers, journal papers) --> lab_publications.bib
* Presentations (talks) --> lab_presentations.bib
* Posters (and interactive presentations) --> lab_posters.bib

For each bibliography entry, in addition to author, title and year, make sure to include:
* A key: The key will be the first three letter of the last name of the lead author plus a two digit code for the year. So ap aper publiched by Frank Wood in 1920 will be coded as "WOO-20". If more than one publication was publiched by the same person, in the same year, add letters. For example, if our hypothetical Frank Wood had another paper in 1920, it will be coded as "WOO-20a".
* A link (if available). For presentations, no need to include a link; this will be generated after upload to the website. For papers, Arxiv link or doi are prefered.
* For Arxiv papers, make sure to use archiveprefix = {arXiv}, and eprint = {1906.05462}.
* For presenations and posters, make sure to include event data: eventtitle = {Forschungswelten 2018}, eventdate  = {2018-04-19/2018-04-20}, venue = {St. Gallen, Switzerland}.
